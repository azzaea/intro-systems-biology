## In-class demo

Lecture notes contain Turing simulation code; additional parameter suggestions in [Brooks](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/file/0015/3327/brooks.pdf)

## Suggested reading:

Iglesias's *Spatial Modeling*: Turing pattern material is in the middle, but the chapter in this folder is relevant to MCB 135
